# Cyber Security Internship: Task 3 - Vulnerability Scan

## Overview
This repository contains the deliverables for Task 3 of the Cyber Security Internship. The task involved performing a vulnerability scan on the local machine (`192.168.1.12`) using Nessus Essentials to identify security risks.

## Tools Used

- Target: `192.168.1.12` (local Linux machine).

## Files
- `report.md`: Detailed vulnerability scan report with findings and mitigations.
- `scan_results.txt`: Raw Nessus scan output for the SMB Signing Not Required vulnerability.

# Phishing Email Analysis Report

## Objective

Analyze a sample phishing email to identify characteristics of phishing attacks.

## Tools Used

- Email Client: Gmail (for viewing email and headers)
- Header Analyzer: MXToolbox (https://mxtoolbox.com/EmailHeaders.aspx)
- URL Scanner: VirusTotal (https://www.virustotal.com/)

## Sample Email Details

- **Source**: Sample phishing email from PhishTank.
- **Subject**: "Urgent: Your PayPal Account is Suspended!"
- **Sender**: `support@paypa1.com`

## Phishing Indicators Found

1. **Sender’s Email Address (Spoofing)**:

   - The sender’s address `support@paypa1.com` mimics `support@paypal.com` but uses a "1" instead of "l".
   - This is a common spoofing tactic to trick users into believing the email is legitimate.

2. **Email Header Discrepancies**:

   - Analyzed headers using MXToolbox.
   - The "Received" field showed the email originated from an IP (`192.0.2.1`) not associated with PayPal’s official mail servers.
   - SPF record failed, indicating the sender domain is not authorized.

3. **Suspicious Links**:

   - Email contained a link labeled "Verify Your Account."
   - Hovering revealed the actual URL: `http://paypa1.com/login`.
   - VirusTotal flagged the URL as malicious.

4. **Suspicious Attachments**:

   - No attachments were present in this sample.

5. **Urgent or Threatening Language**:

   - The email used phrases like “Your account will be locked in 24 hours!” and “Click here immediately to verify.”
   - This creates urgency to manipulate the recipient into acting quickly.

6. **Mismatched URLs**:

   - The displayed link text (“Verify Your Account”) did not match the actual URL (`http://paypa1.com/login`).
   - Legitimate emails typically use consistent, official domains.

7. **Spelling/Grammar Errors**:

   - Found typos: “verifiy” instead of “verify” and “acount” instead of “account.”
   - Inconsistent formatting (e.g., mixed fonts) was observed.

## Summary

The email exhibits multiple phishing traits: a spoofed sender address, header discrepancies, a malicious link, urgent language, mismatched URLs, and spelling errors. These indicate an attempt to steal user credentials via social engineering.
